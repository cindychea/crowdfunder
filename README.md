# crowdfunder
A crowdfunding app similar in concept to Kickstarter.

With this app, users can create projects and set funding goals. They are also able to view other projects and back them according to different reward levels.
In developing this app, user stories were created and prioritized, and Trello was used for project and task management. This app was a collaborative effort by three developers, and was created in three days.
